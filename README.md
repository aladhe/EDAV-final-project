This is the final project assignment of STAT5702 EDAV. Our team is going to make some anlysis on several kinds of financial index in the US in a 10~20 years time range in order to get a conclusion which of them can represent the change of economical situation better.

This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/EDAVtemplate.

There are some questions that we have came up with:

1.We want to discover certain investment strategies in the stock market. In Asset Allocation Strategy Analysis, when we calculate the monthly returns CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) funds, we believe that CTA strategies are playing a major role in portfolio diversification and volatility reduction. So, do CTA strategies have a consistent monthly return or they may vary sometimes?

2.Since we want to use the project to decompose the performance of CTA strategies and explore to what extent does incorporating CTA strategies affect portfolio performances, we want to explore whether the CTA strategies would provide a consistent return in the financial crisis in 2008 based on the data we have?

3.We are eager to discuss if the result of our simulations car verify CTA’s potential for higher returns with lower risks. Hence, we plan to construct two asset allocation models with different weights, one with 50% in stocks and 50% in bonds, and another one with weights 40% in stocks, 40% in bonds, and 20% in CTA to compare their performance to demonstrate the performance of CTA strategies.

Here is the description of the origin of our data:

We download the S&P500 stock data  and  Index performance for Bloomberg US Agg Total Return Value Unhedged USD (LBUSTRUU) from https://www.bloomberg.com/.  The data of the stock  and broad market U.S. bond index ranges from 1/3/2000 to 2/29/2021, which provides us with a comprehensive insights of the market information.  Because Bloomberg Professional Services are not free for the public, we subscribed the membership and then were able to search for the stock data we expected to see.
