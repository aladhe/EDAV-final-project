[["index.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction This project is created by Xinrui Bai (xb2160), Siyuan Sang (ss6165), and Zewen Shi (zs2487) for STAT GR5702 Final Project. With the explosive growth of investments in CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) funds, CTA strategies are playing a major role in portfolio diversification and volatility reduction. We are interested in the appeal and the mechanisms of CTA strategies, as total CTA assets have exceeded $66 billion. Commodity Trading Advisors (CTA) is another term for managed futures strategy, an investment strategy by which professional investors take advantage of the fluctuations of futures prices to earn profits in the futures market. CTA funds play a prominent role in asset allocation, as they have the potential to reduce risks and increase profits of investment portfolios. Mature investment institutions, ranging from pension funds, sovereign funds, and family trusts, have taken CTAs as a part of their standard strategies of portfolio management. This project will decompose the performance of CTA strategies by comparing CTA indexes with indexes of other financial assets, using data visualization techniques. Also, this project intends to provide transparent visualizations of this strategy, so traders without any background in statistics would easily understand the effect of incorporating CTA strategies on risks and investment returns. Here is the link of GitHub that contains all our work for the project https://github.com/aladhe/EDAV-final-project "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources In the process of data collection, first, we compiled historical data on three key indexes from Yahoo Finance, Wind, and Bloomberg, aiming for maximum market coverage: Eurekahedge CTA Index, S&amp;P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite Index from January 2020 to February 2021. Then, we decided to add one more index, the US Aggregate Bond Index, to make it more comprehensive, which was not found on any outside source so we had to purchase it from an inside source at Bloomberg. For the integrity of this research, we decided not to use any other indexes to replace it, because it was often the default option for conducting fixed income research. The process of getting the historical data on this index was arduous but we were insistence on obtaining the most recognized index for our research. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite index are two of the most acknowledged indexes of stocks in the world of finance, and serve as a perfect reference to stock market performance while doing comparison with CTA strategies. We then decided to throw in the Dow&amp;Jones Industrial Average Index because we wanted another price-weighted measurement of the stock market, and it seemed like a decent choice. Our data consists of the date, opening price, the highest price on that trading day, the lowest price on that trading day, closing price, and trading volume. One problem we had with compiling the data was the difference in format of our datasets as they were collected from different sources, and even in different currencies. Therefore, we conducted careful examination and converted everything to US dollars. Data collection was a joint effort of our team members, as each person collected the data of at least one index. We extensively discussed the selection of our indexes, as there were many options, and finalized on these five particular datasets that were later transformed into the format we intended. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Before going into further manipulations, we decided to adopt only the closing price of each index on that particular day for the simplicity of our visualizations, because we were interested in the trend over time instead of the variations within one particular trading day. Also, our datasets came from a variety of sources so they differ significantly in format; we organized the data on excel to make it easier to compute by converting everything into the same form we intended and removed many empty entries. Because our indexes were radically different in mean values, some in hundreds and some in tens of thousands, we decided to do a computation of (X-minimum value) divided by (maximum value-minimum value), and use this proportion for future visualizations. Therefore, all of our indexes could easily fit into the same plot. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Because we want to explore the situation of the missing values in the data set, we expect to visualize the missing patterns of our data set. The columns represent five kinds of indexes, which are CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) Index, S&amp;P 500 Index, Nasdaq Composite Index, US Aggregate Bond Index, and Dow&amp;Jones Industrial Average Index. Columns 2-6 describes the categorization of different kinds of indexes we have utilized in the project. We want to use the function used for plotting the missing patterns to verify the situation of the missing patterns of these five main attributes. Based on the plot above, we can see that for all five kinds of indexes, there is no missing value pattern. Columns 7-10 describes the categorization of different kinds of normalization results of indexes we have utilized in the project. We want to use the function used for plotting the missing patterns to verify the situation of the missing patterns of these five main attributes. Based on the plot above, we can see that for all five kinds of indexes, there is no missing value pattern.

The most notable trend would be the steep decline in 2008 followed by the financial crisis and in 2020 because of the effect of the coronavirus on the economy. Besides these temporary declines, the two stock indexes have grown at a reasonable rate throughout the years. As shown on the plot, the performance of our Bond index has been steadily improving over the past 20 years at a slow pace, as is the trait of this particular investment, offering stable but limited returns. As shown on the plot, the Nasdaq Composite Index slowly declined from a short-term high at around 2000 followed by the burst of the Internet Bubble, started to recover at around 2003, then plummeted at 2008 because of the financial crisis, and finally started this drastic increase in value since recently prompted by the rapid development of the American technology industry. As shown on the plot, interestingly, we have found out that the CTA Index was able to remain intact in 2008 and the effect of the financial crisis was minimal on this particular strategy. It has grown rapidly as more funds begun to adapt this strategy as a profit booster and risk control mechanism. It had its own low point at 2015, as the commodity market had an unprecedented catastrophe, as prices for everything, from crude oil to industrial metals such as iron ore and copper, plummeted. As shown on the plot, the Dow&amp;Jones Industrial Average Indexes have generally followed similar trend because they have similar components. The most notable trend would be the steep decline in 2008 followed by the financial crisis and in 2020 because of the effect of the coronavirus on the economy. Besides these temporary declines, the two stock indexes have grown at a reasonable rate throughout the years. Combining these time series plots together, we have clearly observed that the CTA Index has led the market on investment returns most of the times, and remained unaffected in the financial crisis of 2008, even if it has shown greater volatility than other indexes. 5.2 Times-series Connected Scatterplots 5.3 Correlation Graphs between different Indexes 5.4 Relations between different Indexes 5.5 Boxplots for different Indexes ## Error in get(genname, envir = envir) : 找不到对象&#39;testthat_print&#39; "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component When we talk about the stock market in the 21st century, we have to mention the 2008 financial crisis. There is no time when the closing price of a stock will affect people’s hearts more than this time. Therefore, I chose stock data from 2007 to 2009 in order to see more clearly the monthly changes in market conditions during this period. We applied the three most common stock indexes, Nasdaq, Dow Jones, and S.P500 to characterize the changes during this period. The deeply recessed line charts intuitively shows how stock indexes have fallen like a dive in just a few months. Judging from the images in the past two years, the rise and fall of the three stock indexes are relatively consistent, which is in line with our previous analysis that the three stock indexes have relatively strong correlations. At the same time, all three stock indexes have fallen significantly since mid-2008, and reached their local minimums around April 2009. The local minimum of Dow Jones is even really close to its historical minimum in this century(6547.05) "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Summary 7.2 Lessons Learned", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Summary We have obtained invaluable hands-on experience of producing a visualization project from scratch. Starting with the selection of datasets, we obtained datasets from five different sources and even requested help of a Bloomberg professional to get the most professional data for our study. Utilizing the skills and techniques we have learned throughout the semester, we cleaned up our raw data, transformed our data into the same format, and extracted the most essential piece of information in it. For the most important part of this project, we exploited a variety of plots we have learned in this course, including bar chart, box plot, histogram, etc. We have also taken advantage of our takeaways from our community contribution assignment by uploading this assignment to Github, so we can contribute to the community and hopefully serve people in the financial industry with little background in statistics by providing transparent graphical illustration of the performance of CTA strategies. This project has been a great opportunity for us to review the important techniques what we have learned in this class, to apply our expertise in statistics to solve problems in other fields, and to contribute to the community in a way that provokes further discussions of this subject. Finally, we reiterate the main findings of our project: though CTA performance has been volatile over the last decade, our findings generally support that CTAs have significant potential in generating higher returns and an insurance policy when the value of other indexes steeply decline. For example, the time theories plot has shown when the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 took a dive in the financial crisis of 2008, the value of the CTA Index kept increasing through such dire market conditions. 7.2 Lessons Learned Theoretically, as long as there are tradable trends, CTA strategies will continue to thrive. As the world becomes increasingly volatile, such as the COVID-19 pandemic creating unprecedented volatilities in the market, the value of CTAs will rise as insurance against these drastic changes, as confirmed by our visualizations. The difference in trends between CTA Index and other indexes shown on the plots suggests the validity of the strategy as a hedge against significant exposures in the stock market. From a financial standpoint, however, investors should not expect CTAs to be a panacea for underperforming portfolios. Past performance of CTAs is not indicative of future results, and for CTA strategies to function properly, research-oriented efforts should remain the focus of portfolio managers.
